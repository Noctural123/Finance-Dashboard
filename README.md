This is the starting point for the **Finance Dashboard** project. Itâ€™s a full-stack application built using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js) to track and manage financial data.

## Setup
1. Clone the repository.
2. Navigate to both the `client` and `server` directories.
3. Run `npm install` in both directories to install dependencies.
4. Start the server and client using `npm run dev`.
